AppWizard has created this StereoDownmixer project for you. This project not 
only demonstrates the basics of developing basic DirectShow Transform
Filter, but is also a starting point for writing your own filters. This 
file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that 
make up your StereoDownmixer project.

       DirectShow Transform Filter "StereoDownmixer"
=======================================================================

This project implements a DirectShow Transform Filter StereoDownmixer:
(Note: the Transform in-place filter is more buggy although it may be a
little bit more efficient because it does not need to copy the sample).

iStereoDownmixer.h : The header file that defines the GUIDs and the
  interface to control the CStereoDownmixer filter. To use this filter in
  another application, just include this header file.

StereoDownmixer.h / StereoDownmixer.cpp : The definition and implementation
  of CStereoDownmixer filter. This filter can be inserted into a graph to
  process the media data (using GraphEdt.exe or write your own app).

StereoDownmixerProp.h / StereoDownmixerProp.cpp : The property page of the
  CStereoDownmixer filter. It provides a property page to control the 
  parameters of the CStereoDownmixer filter.

resource.h : the constant for the resources of this project (property
  pages ...).

StereoDownmixer.rc : The resource file (property pages ...)
