5.1 to stereo Quasi-Dolby Surround Pro Logic downmix

5.1 input, stereo output, downmix similar to the one performed by hardware Dolby Surround Pro Logic (R) encoders.
The two back speakers are to be summed together. The result is to be added half power to FL, and half power inverted phase to FR.

0.70710678118 is the square root of 0.5, that is, the factor needed to halven the sound power.

This is the algorithm as posted by S_O in the everwicked.com forum (thanks to S_O for this):

FL = FL + 0.707(FC + FLC + FRC) + 0.707(RL + RR) + 0.707 LF
FR = FR + 0.707(FC + FLC + FRC) - 0.707(RL + RR) + 0.707 LF


To make a full Dolby Surround Pro Logic (R) downmix you would need to add a 7KHz lowpass to (RL+RR) before mixing it and also a Dolby B noise reduction step (not possible to do this within my Channel Downmixer)
